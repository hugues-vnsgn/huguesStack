# Host loading

The marketplace entry points to `./plugin`. The plugin manifest lives at
`plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. Component paths resolve from the plugin root.

Claude's [manifest reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins-reference)
places metadata in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and skills at the plugin root.
The local CLI help exposes `--plugin-dir` for session-local loading and
`plugin validate` for static validation. A copied template alone proves neither
host discovery nor skill invocation.

## Claude Code

From this repository, validate without starting a model session:

```sh
claude plugin validate --strict ./plugin
claude plugin validate --strict ./.claude-plugin/marketplace.json
```

The following was the WP1 fresh-session probe command:

```sh
claude --plugin-dir "$PLUGIN_DIRECTORY" --print '/hugues-stack:hugues-mode'
```

Set `PLUGIN_DIRECTORY` to the plugin directory for the checkout being tested.
Claude Code 2.1.286 passed this direct invocation in a fresh session on
4 October 2026: the exact probe reply matched and the command exited 0.
Invoking the probe through the Skill tool was rejected because the skill uses
`disable-model-invocation`; the direct command is the appropriate probe method.
Record the host version, plugin Git SHA,
argv, exit code, and full reply in an evidence folder outside this repository.
The WP1 probe reply contained the two fixed lines documented in
[WP1 validation](wp1-validation.md). WP2 replaces that probe with the router. A model that merely repeats
a token from the user prompt has not proved skill discovery: invoke the skill
by name without supplying the token or its body.

## WP3 Claude invocation observations

On 5 October 2026, Claude Code 2.1.286 / `claude-fable-5-1`, high effort,
successfully invoked an existing project recipe through its native Skill tool.
The fresh session included `--setting-sources project,local` and the consumer's
canonical skill plus verified Claude-directory symlink. Earlier restricted and
empty-setting-source probes returned unknown-skill; their failures remain in
the evidence. No symlink freshness cause was established.

A separate fresh session loaded this checkout's plugin with `--plugin-dir` and
invoked `/hugues-stack:create-verification-skill` directly. The generator uses
`disable-model-invocation: true`; direct user invocation is the appropriate path.
It read the repository and template and returned a complete private candidate,
exit 0. It performed no file write, build or drive. Preserve an existing recipe's
invocation metadata when considering a candidate update; review any proposed
change to how the host can invoke it. Claude's `disable-model-invocation` and
Codex's `allow_implicit_invocation` govern different host behavior and are not
interchangeable flags.

Both probes were read-only sessions: plan permission mode, only Skill/Read/Glob/
Grep tools, no persistence, strict empty MCP configuration, and per-invocation
`disableAllHooks`. That isolation is evidence for loading only. Use the consumer's
normal hook and execution policy for implementation or command-running sessions;
these probes supply no authority to disable those controls. Record argv, settings
sources, tool availability and actual invocation response separately from the
candidate's content. See [verification continuation](verification-continuation.md)
for that historical full-cycle gap and the [current evidence index](evidence-index.md)
for the later applied cycle and its remaining limits.

## Codex

**Codex native marketplace discovery** is **observed-pass**. The
[PR #1 reviewer](https://github.com/hugues-vnsgn/huguesStack/pull/1) reported this
per-invocation override on 4 October 2026 with Codex 0.160.0 (`$REPO` denotes the
reviewed checkout):

```sh
codex -c 'marketplaces.hs.source_type="local"' -c "marketplaces.hs.source=\"$REPO\"" plugin list
```

The output listed `` Marketplace `hugues-stack` `` at
`$REPO/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` and the row
`hugues-stack@hugues-stack  not installed  $REPO/plugin`.
`~/.codex/config.toml` was byte-identical before and after. Codex names the
marketplace after the manifest's `name`, rather than the config key `hs`.
This records the reviewer's observation; the override was not rerun here.

**Codex native install and `$hugues-mode` invocation** remains **unrun**.
The historical WP1 probe was blocked by its scope.
`codex plugin add` installs globally and was not run.

Use a disposable project skill fallback only when the coordinator authorizes
that host probe. In the observed Codex 0.160.0 run on 4 October 2026, a temporary
scratch project's `.agents/skills` symlink exposed the project skills. A fresh
session discovered `hugues-mode`, inspected its file with a read-only `cat`, and
invoked `$hugues-mode`; the exact probe reply matched and the session exited 0.
Label this result **manual project skill**. No global installation was performed.
Keep temporary symlinks outside the plugin repository: its static checker rejects
repository symlinks. Record the actual scratch setup with the run evidence.

A WP1 manual probe does not demonstrate the marketplace entry, plugin namespacing,
mode persistence, routing, delegation or mobile execution. Those checks have
separate cells in [support](support.md).

## Static checker boundary

`scripts/check-plugin.sh` delegates to `scripts/check_plugin.py` and keeps the same
`[repository-root]` argument and exit codes. With no argument, the Python checker
uses the repository containing the script, independently of the working directory.

It checks the manifest shape, relative component
paths, repository symlinks, single-line skill frontmatter, unique names and
descriptions, and local Markdown link files and heading fragments. It accepts
inline links and full/collapsed reference links. Blank or whitespace-only
frontmatter lines and `#` comment lines are accepted. Keep authored frontmatter to
plain or quoted single-line scalar values; YAML blocks and nested values are
outside this checker, and YAML lists are rejected. An unparseable line reports
`unsupported frontmatter line; WP1 accepts single-line "key: value" scalars`;
duplicate keys report `invalid or duplicate frontmatter field`.
Single-quoted values require closing quotes and doubled
apostrophes (`''`); backslashes remain literal. The checker skips `.git` and leaves the immutable
`docs/planning` snapshots out of Markdown/frontmatter linting. It still rejects
symlinks there. External link availability is not checked.

Run the host's own validator as well as the static checker before claiming host
metadata compatibility. A successful static check is not an observed host load.

WP2 preserves one upstream local link from `principle-explain-the-number` to the
unshipped `benchmark-checklist` skill. The checker accepts it only with the exact
known source and target, pstack pin, verbatim source SHA-256 and matching
[provenance receipt](upstream/wp2-provenance.json). It prints `DEFERRED` visibly.
Altered source bytes, a different broken link, excess or malformed exceptions,
a changed pin or a newly shipped target fail. This exception preserves the
upstream file; it does not claim the deferred helper is available.

## WP2 applicability

WP1 probe results establish the package and historical loader behavior for that
revision. WP2 changes the skill body, enables its routing guidance and adds a
worker plus principle and review skills. The old probe token is no longer a
WP2 acceptance test. Run the package checks and both Claude static validators
against the WP2 revision; record live routing separately.

For Codex, a fresh disposable project may expose this checkout's skills through
`.agents/skills` for a manual project-skill route preview. Record the exact plugin
SHA, setup, host version, selected file, copied steps, domain and proof, with
argv and exit status outside the repository. Use the literal prompts in the
[WP2 fixture](../tests/fixtures/wp2-routing-prompts.json). The initial coordinator
preview used six cases with Codex 0.160.0 on 4 October 2026:
six expected routes, domains and all 38 numbered steps matched, exit 0. The host
exposed no todo/plan tool, so the displayed checklist fallback was observed;
native todo integration remains unverified. Eight read-only skill-file reads
supplied the preview. A preview must stop before delegation or consumer execution. This tests planning behavior through
the manual path; it does not demonstrate native plugin invocation or delegated
execution. The six-case result describes head `17ba517`; changes after that
preview need separate verification.

After the six review fixes, a fresh Codex 0.160.0 manual preview exited 0 with
all eleven expected routes and domains matched, including the five explicit
intent cases. All 61 numbered steps matched the current selected files
byte-for-byte. Thirteen read-only skill-file reads succeeded; no delegates,
writes or consumer commands ran. All 48 plugin file fingerprints matched the
preview. The host again exposed no todo/plan tool, so this result covers the
displayed JSON checklist fallback. Native todo integration remains unrun. The
final tested head and review result are recorded in
[PR #3](https://github.com/hugues-vnsgn/huguesStack/pull/3).

The owner subsequently authorized Claude Code review. Claude Code 2.1.286 with
`claude-opus-5-5` completed a static code review of that head in plan permission
mode using only Read, Glob and Grep. This review did not load the plugin, invoke
its router or execute a worker. Record code review separately from routing and
runtime checks; see the [review audit](reviews/wp2-claude-review.md).

See [WP1 validation](wp1-validation.md) for historical evidence and incomplete
initial probe attempts, and [WP2 validation](wp2-validation.md) for current
acceptance boundaries.

## Historical RC1 probes

The historical `0.1.0-rc.1` read-only previews completed on 6 October 2026. Claude Code
2.1.290 directly loaded the session-local plugin; its event stream confirms
`claude-opus-5-5`. Codex 0.160.1 used a disposable manual project-skill symlink
and direct reads. It inherited configured `gpt-6.1-sol` without an override;
the actual served model is not exposed in the retained stream. No native Codex
installation or invocation is established.

Each preview matched 16 route/file decisions across all fourteen playbooks plus
`interrogate`, and 87 numbered steps exactly. The original eleven fixture
domain/proof decisions matched. The supplemental Android Gradle-only prompt
established no implementation language: Codex left it unresolved, while Claude
inferred Kotlin without repository evidence. Both hosts lacked native todo tools
and used displayed checklists. These are planning observations, not full mode
execution or proof of every supplemental domain choice.

Initial read-only sandbox attempts failed with Claude `authentication_failed`
and Codex runtime `Operation not permitted`. The same scoped CLI probes then
completed under authorized escalation for existing authentication/runtime access.
Both failures remain retained; no installation, global settings change or
permission bypass occurred. Route probes restricted tools and disabled hooks
per invocation. Their isolation grants no implementation authority.

A separate initial synthetic Claude session kept normal hook policy and launched the
registered `hugues-stack:hugues-agent` and a fresh native Explore reviewer.
Parented events show mode/principle reads. Claude denied the one exact scratch
Write despite the explicit one-path `allowedTools` setting: the authorized
probe lacked an effective matching grant and its noninteractive session had no
approval surface. This was a probe setup/runtime permission limit, not withheld
owner authority or a platform automatic approval review rejection. The target
stayed absent; this attempt executed no behavioral assertions. The reviewer's
static assessment of an unwritten proposal accepted no artifact. Its proposal
also consumed generators during validation, a distinct static defect.

A fresh bounded check corrected only the exact scratch-file grant to
`Edit(//absolute/path/normalize_topics.py)`, covering the requested and resolved
aliases. Claude's [permission rules](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/permissions#read-and-edit)
use Edit rules for built-in writes and `//` for absolute paths. The fresh
registered worker wrote the artifact once; a fresh Explore reviewer read its
actual source and found no behavior defects. CLI exit was 0 with no permission
denial. Normal hooks/settings stayed unchanged; no bypass or broad Edit/Write
grant was used. The original denied packet remains intact.

The outer worker's 22 assertions and the coordinator's independent 14 literal
checks passed on the same artifact. These overlapping sets are reported
separately; no commands or tests ran inside the native Claude session. This
proves bounded scratch delegation/artifact behavior, with same-host process
independence. Full mode execution, mobile delegation, red-green, generated-recipe
cycle and persistence remain unrun.

All 54 plugin file fingerprints and both user-settings hashes matched before
and after on exact RC1 plugin bytes at `21a82942019292f7212ff1185e9ef187ac96e86d`.
The RC2 package has 79 plugin files and changed mode/playbook bodies. These
RC1 probes cover only their original revision. The [RC validation receipt](rc-validation.md)
binds that historical packet; later [RC2 host observations](rc2-host-validation.md)
record native Claude loading, manual Codex previews, bounded synthetic work and
fresh lane-evidence probes. Full eight-workflow adherence and mobile execution
remain unrun. Record final-head checks and independent review separately in the
RC draft before acceptance.

## RC2 loading and lane-evidence probes

Fresh RC2 sessions used Claude Code 2.1.290's session-local native plugin loader
and Codex 0.160.1's disposable manual project-skill path. At `e2ff899`, each
matched sixteen route/file choices and 87 numbered steps; Claude registered all
35 skills and the custom worker. Codex separately discovered the marketplace
entry without installing it. Native Codex installation and namespaced invocation
remain unrun. These previews exposed no native todo tool.

Both original RC2 replies inferred Kotlin from an Android/Gradle-only request.
The revised [lane evidence rule](../plugin/skills/hugues-mode/references/mobile-lanes.md#lane-evidence)
separates platform, language, framework/shared ownership and affected target.
Six fresh cases on baseline and candidate bytes used the same structured prompt,
with scoped fixture-source reads where permitted. Each host copied all 36
`build-doctor` steps exactly. Candidate language/lane observations and strict
comparison mismatches are recorded separately in the [RC2 receipt](rc2-host-validation.md#lane-evidence-probes).
A formatted response and static contract checks do not establish general model
compliance or authorize consumer execution.

Fresh repaired schema probes on corrected, uncommitted plugin bytes each passed
six unique cases and 36 copied steps. The prompt added a target-component/evidence
schema and canonical lane format; fixture expectations and declaration metadata
were withheld. The [repaired receipt](rc2-host-validation.md#repaired-schema-probes)
binds all 79 plugin fingerprints and actual fixture reads. These planning-only
results used a different protocol from the initial probes. Full workflow
adherence, native mobile execution and general host reliability remain unproven.

## Final 0.1.0 metadata boundary

The final candidate changes the plugin manifest version to `0.1.0` and preserves
the skill, playbook and worker bodies. The RC2 receipts above retain their exact
historical bindings; no fresh host load with the 0.1.0 manifest is claimed.
Native Codex installation and namespaced invocation remain unproven;
marketplace discovery and manual/direct-read fallback retain their observed scopes.
