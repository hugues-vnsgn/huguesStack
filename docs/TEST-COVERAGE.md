# Python test roots and evidence limits

The candidate collects **385 top-level unittest cases**. One is a driver that
separately executes **50 frozen 0.2.0 restoration cases**. Do not add the driver
and its children as independent coverage, or describe historical passes as current
native workflow proof. Subtests are not added to case totals.

| Group | Collected cases | Evidence |
|---|---:|---|
| Historical 0.1.0 contracts | 131 | Unchanged SHA256-bound release archive |
| Current checker, historical 0.1.0 fixtures | 27 | Explicit historical validation mode and package mutations |
| Historical 0.2.0 restoration driver | 1 | Executes 50 cases inside a separate hash-bound archive |
| Current source/provenance checks | 44 | test_upstream_sync (33), test_retained_provenance (11) |
| Current installed adapters and regressions | 97 | test_host_adapters (72), test_review_regressions (12), test_rereview_regressions (13) |
| Current native-layout contracts | 48 | test_native_layout; canonical source, permissions, host invocation table, seal acceptance, helper receipt, budgets and the native-reach lint (a corpus of 45 reviewed contradictions in five line shapes each, 16 correct sentences, the package wiring and a one-entry allowlist), plus the router rewrite: router section pointers and the Principles index, the four dead Cursor frontmatter fields through the plugin check, and seven read-only cases on the router and the files it points at (title, host tool names and description, mobile routes, autonomy placement, single-source model defaults, the scope of restated obligations, the registered `hugues-agent` name and question tool per host, worker definition) |
| Current progressive-disclosure contracts | 13 | test_context_disclosure; retained rules, mandatory phase reads, complete declared source inventories, the skill-list budget (including its pinned pre-PR `a67df90` point), YAML-description quoting, the router's initial read set against `main`'s pinned read set and bound resources |
| Current installed-tolerance regressions | 24 | test_installed_tolerance; bootstrap dependencies, host metadata, unreadable folders, umask modes, every spelling of a raw skill read, normalized paths (`.`, `..`, letter case, repeated slashes), open quotes and split code spans, every revision/syntax a skill-body guard must still check, the plan-check helper's operand, and a rejection matrix of 1,840 cases (306 `read-workflow`, 1,484 `translate-plan` and 50 in-plan cases) over all 50 bundled skills, their legacy aliases, consumer and external paths, with symlink and traversal cases and positive controls |
| Total collected | 385 | Current, mixed and historical scopes remain distinct |

The 131 historical modules are test_wp2_contract (45), test_wp3_contract (15),
test_retained_design (7), test_retained_research (8), test_retained_verification (6),
test_retained_integration (26) and test_lane_evidence (24). Their root is
`release_root()`. No frozen archive was modified to make a current test pass.
The newly retained 0.2.0 archive is the original `509cbec` Git tree, not the
candidate layout. Its 50 restored-contract cases remain historical evidence.
Main collected 349 cases. Moving those 50 behind one driver and adding 29
native-layout plus eight disclosure cases gives 337, without dropping the frozen
50 executions or counting them twice. The preceding native candidate had 329.
The review-fix pass adds five native-layout and nine installed-tolerance cases,
giving 351. The historical driver now also fails when any nested case is skipped.
Restoring pstack's router design adds one skill-list budget disclosure case,
giving 352. PR 1 fix round 1 adds one native-layout case (an unknown skill body
still refuses translation), one disclosure case (YAML-description quoting) and
two installed-tolerance cases (a bundled skill's exact SKILL.md path now
translates and reads; round 3 reversed both), giving 356. PR 1 fix round 2 adds two native-layout
cases (the native-reach lint rejects a reintroduced contradiction, and passes
the reviewed auto-load-disabled sentence), one disclosure case (the pinned
`a67df90` pre-PR skill-list point recomputes to 46 skills and the Issue's
cited character count) and four installed-tolerance cases (a skill-body guard
still fires at every Git revision and unsupported shell form, and
`hugues-mode`/`setup-huguesstack` stay native-only for both `read-workflow`
and `translate-plan`), giving 363. PR 1 fix round 3 takes the helper relaxation
back out: the cases that translated and read a bundled SKILL.md become
refusals, and seven installed-tolerance cases are added (the six-case
rejection matrix over every bundled skill, alias, consumer and external path
and plan form, and a consumer-symlink case) with two native-layout cases (the
reworked native-reach lint now has a reviewed-contradiction corpus, a
package-wiring case, a correct-sentence case and an allowlist case, replacing
two), giving 372. PR 1 fix round 4 adds no case: it adds ten contradictions
and four correct sentences to the lint corpus (the mobile-workflows sentence,
the fresh-worker read of "any bundled skill", and host-loading spellings), widens
the lint to catch them and records its limits in the corpus file, and extends
the adapter-partition case to the mobile adapter's recorded replacement, so the
total stays 372. The router rewrite (issue #22) adds seven native-layout cases
(the router-section and Principles-index check with its mutations, the four dead
frontmatter fields run through the plugin check, and five read-only cases on the
rewritten router and the files it points at) and two disclosure cases (the
router's initial read set recomputes smaller than `main`'s, and drift in the
pinned `a67df90` read-set fixture is rejected), giving 381. Its fix round adds two
more read-only router cases (the scope words that positive rewrites had dropped, and
the per-host registered `hugues-agent` name and question tool), giving 383.
The skill-path normalization fix adds two installed-tolerance cases (normalized
paths, and open quotes or split code spans), giving 385.

Current adapter cases execute the public installed Python entrypoint in disposable
external consumer directories, including Node plan validation when available.
Bindings cover canonical files, metadata, adapters, policies, runtime code and
permission modes. Tests reject missing/extra files, symlinks, world-writable files,
changed executable bits, bootstrap execution before verification, poisoned
bytecode caches, consumer path ownership errors and unsupported shell shapes.
No SKILL.md is returned by `read-workflow` or translated by `translate-plan`:
every spelling (a bundled skill's exact path or legacy alias, a wrong prefix,
an absolute path, a consumer, external or model-invocable skill, at any Git
revision or shell form) is rejected, so no helper read can stand in for a
native invocation or for the agent's own file read of a user-only skill.
Tests do not simulate a successful host permission decision.

The unchanged activity parser is exercised with synthetic Claude/Codex records,
relative contexts, malformed/unsupported inputs, empty sources, duplicate/deep
JSON and unknown PR metadata. Candidate-specific holds and exit 2 remain required.
The active/pinned-chat gate stays separate. No real transcript was read and no
real worktree was deleted.

Native-layout cases compare all 50 public names and modes, archive/source identity,
canonical mapping, workflow phase/cardinality/fallback constraints, the
reviewed host invocation table, consumer boundaries and a measured source-context budget.
Hash resealing cannot approve a lost phase gate or changed invocation policy.
Invocation metadata checks use effective fields, rejecting duplicate fields and
comment decoys. Plans containing only bound workflow reads pass the plan gate
without an incidental consumer Git read; missing binding markers still fail.
The budget uses bytes and characters/4; it is not measured host context.

Current host discovery/invocation, complete persisted-transcript compatibility,
worker dispatch, mobile device journeys and forge/cloud/loop execution remain
unverified. Earlier native observations are bound to their original revisions.
Historical Bun/TypeScript helper results remain separate from any new candidate
run recorded in the implementation evidence.
Their source and dependency inputs remain unchanged; the Node plan checker did
change and has current Python/Node integration coverage. The disclosure-pass
Bun/TypeScript run was blocked before execution by sandbox preflight `EPERM`. The
review-fix pass ran it on a scratch install of the candidate: Bun 1.4.2,
`bun install --frozen-lockfile` through the session proxy, 52 of 52 `bun test orch
watch-pr` cases and strict `tsc --noEmit` for watch-pr passed. That run is outside
the Python suite and is not counted above. See the
[helper input receipt](HELPER-INPUTS.json) and [context report](CONTEXT-FOOTPRINT.md).
