# huguesStack

huguesStack is the standalone adaptation of pstack for first-class mobile development through Claude Code and Codex.

## Language

**huguesStack**:
The project named by the product owner for this mobile-first pstack adaptation.
_Avoid_: Mobile Stack, mobile stack as the product name

**Mobile domains**:
The four first-class areas covered by huguesStack: native Swift/iOS, native Kotlin/Android, Kotlin Multiplatform shared logic, and Compose Multiplatform shared UI.
_Avoid_: Primary native platforms with secondary multiplatform support

**Consumer app**:
A mobile application that huguesStack helps its owner develop and verify. It is a separate project from huguesStack.
_Avoid_: Bundled demo app, plugin app

**Upstream responsibility**:
An identifiable purpose or behavior supplied or required by the pinned pstack baseline, regardless of the file or feature that carries it.
_Avoid_: File count as feature parity

**Master inventory**:
The complete accounting of upstream responsibilities, including items recommended for adaptation, deferral, or exclusion.
_Avoid_: Selected subset, implementation checklist

**Observed support**:
Support demonstrated by evidence from the actual claimed host, mobile domain, target, and workflow.
_Avoid_: Assumed support, installed support

**Release candidate**:
A bounded version presented for acceptance against declared requirements, with its supporting evidence and remaining limitations visible.
_Avoid_: Full parity, production-ready by date alone

**Layer 1**:
The huguesStack plugin itself: skills, playbooks, principles, one agent definition, two scripts and docs, installed in Claude Code and Codex from a marketplace manifest. It is the whole 0.1.0 release candidate.
_Avoid_: The harness, the runtime, the core

**Layer 2**:
hstack-alpha's Orca-managed worker runtime, Work Units and captured-review contracts, kept as a deferred option. Its existing evidence is never cited as Layer 1 proof.
_Avoid_: Phase 2, the full product

**hugues-mode**:
The huguesStack router skill, forked from pstack's `poteto-mode`. It matches a request to a playbook, copies the steps into the todo list, and names a domain lane and proof surface for build and bug work.
_Avoid_: mobile-mode, the orchestrator

**Proof lane**:
The build, target tests and screen check selected for one changed mobile domain, plus the evidence folder that records them. Implemented by the `mobile-proof` playbook.
_Avoid_: Verification pipeline, CI

**Cross-host review**:
An `interrogate` run in the host that did not produce the diff: Claude Code reviews a Codex diff or the reverse. The only model-independent review available when each host's subagents are single-vendor.
_Avoid_: Multi-model panel, second opinion from the same host

**Consumer fixture**:
A small disposable app with a planted defect, used as a consumer when no real app is selected for a domain. The default for KMP and CMP is hstack-alpha's `kmp-compose-ios-pilot`.
_Avoid_: Demo app, sample bundled in the plugin

**Personal-workflow bar**:
The 0.1.0 proof standard: Claude Code primary, Codex smoke-tested, one observed task per domain, gaps listed in `support.md` rather than gating the release. The one fixed rule is that no flaky, skipped or wrong-target result is reported as a pass.
_Avoid_: NO-GO gate, parity bar

**Per-cell state**:
One of authored, static-tested, observed-pass, observed-fail, blocked or deferred, recorded for each host, domain and workflow cell. Distinct from a run outcome such as pass, fail, flaky or skipped.
_Avoid_: Status, done

**Upstream delta**:
The list of files added, changed or removed between the pinned pstack revision and upstream main, produced by blob-SHA comparison and triaged at most weekly.
_Avoid_: Upgrade, resync
