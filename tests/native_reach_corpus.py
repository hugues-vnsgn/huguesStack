"""Regression corpus for the native-reach lint (`check_core.native_reach_violations`).

A user-only bundled skill cannot be invoked by a model, so agent-facing text must never
tell an agent to reach one natively. PR 1's independent reviews found that contradiction
in three rounds, every time in a spelling the previous lint missed. Each CONTRADICTIONS
row is one such spelling: either the exact sentence the repository carried at the commit
named in its label, or the reviewer's phrase placed in a realistic sentence. The lint must
flag every row, however the line is wrapped, and CLEAN must stay unflagged.

Recorded limitations of the lint (not hidden by the corpus):
  * It does not read negation. "Never invoke tdd natively" is flagged exactly like "invoke tdd
    natively", because both name a skill beside a reach word. A true statement of that shape is
    rewritten, or becomes the one reviewed entry in NATIVE_REACH_ALLOWLIST.
  * A prohibition that names no skill and no class is not caught: "never substitute direct body
    reads for unavailable or denied invocation", alone in its clause, is correct for a consumer
    project skill (create-verification-skill's template) and for host.md's "for those skills"
    form, and no lexical rule separates them from the wrong use. The round 4 mobile sentence
    is caught on its other clause, "native invocation for skills".
  * A reach spelling with no reach word the lint knows ("let the harness pull tdd in", "tdd is
    available to you automatically") is not caught; the host-load family it knows is host and
    harness + load, inject, attach, activate or surface.
